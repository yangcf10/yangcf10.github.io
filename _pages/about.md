I am currently a research scientist at Meta AI. Our team applies cutting-edge algorithms to improve recommendation system at Meta scale. Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. from Duke University advised by [Yiran Chen](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/people/yiran-chen) and [Hai Li](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/people/hai-li). My research interests are deep learning security and neuromorphic computing. Over the past summers, I interned at Facebook and KLA-Tencor.
